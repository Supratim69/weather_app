# weather_app
This was the basic ui/ux I came up with before starting the project (https://www.figma.com/file/Ug7gO20GYfxWMROtpqBHKq/Weather-App?node-id=0%3A1&t=xHEiCo8aSh9BLCB1-1)
Although I was not able to implement this design this is what i came up with by taking some inspiration from dribble.
In the current version of the app, I was not able implement the search function properly. The app retrieves data like temperature, sunset time, sunrise time, wind speed,etc and displayes it for the given place.
